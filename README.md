## Geocoding App

### Goal

Create a small rails application where a user can register with an e-mail, password and address,.On
registering the address will be geocoded and after login the results for example: latitude, longitude,
federal state will be displayed to the user.

### Acceptance Criteria

* Registration form with e-mail, password, street, city, zip.
* Login with e-mail and password.
* Geocoding the address with additional info.
* Display infoâ€™s about address like latitude and longitude after login.
* Add tests for your code.
* Provide configuration to run the application in a docker environment.
* This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
